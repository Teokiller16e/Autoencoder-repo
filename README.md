# Stack Autoencoder

This project concerns of a deep learning framework to build a stack autoencoder.Here are some basic aspects of it: 

 a)Imports a huge dataset of images 32x32x3 and reconstructs them using an encoder-decoder.
 
 
 b)Imports a huge dataset of images 32x32x3 and from greyscale images it reconstructs the original color.
 
 
 c)Usage of Tensorflow/Keras A.P.I.
